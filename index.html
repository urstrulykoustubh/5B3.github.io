            <blockquote>
                Today I choose life. Every morning when I wake up I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain... To
                feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices - today I choose to
                feel life, not to deny my humanity but embrace it.

                Happiness is a butterfly, which when pursued, is always just beyond your grasp, but which, if you will
                sit down quietly, may alight upon you.
                <br>

            <blockquote>
                When you get into a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not
                hang on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will
                turn.
                <br>
